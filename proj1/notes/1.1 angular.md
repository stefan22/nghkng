# software library

- collection of implementations of behaviour with a well-defined interface by
  which the behaviour is invoked.
- reuse of behaviour
- modularity
- e.g. jQuery


# software framework

- abstraction in which software provides generic functionality that can be
  selectively changed by additional user-written code.
- e.g. angular, ember, backbone

## angular

![](images/ng.png)

- complete rewrite of framework
- designed with CRUD applications (data-driven) in mind
- component-based
- mobile support
- server-side rendering
- powerful templates

> `one-way/two-way data-binding`, components, `directives`, templates, `routing`, modules, `service`, provider, `testing`

### angular-cli
- https://cli.angular.io
- sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
- new proj: ng new folder --style=scss

#### angular material and flex-layout modules (new UI layout framework)
- similar to using bootstrap
- why not used bootstrap? you can also use bootstrap
  but you can only use the css components part of bootstrap within Angular
- jQuery/javascript-based components cannot be explicitly used. There can be
  some conflicts with code, so it is best to avoid using javascript components
  from Bootstrap inside your angular application.

```
   npm install --save @angular/material@latest

   //add to index.html:
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet" />
   
   //app.module
   import modules


   npm install --save @angular/animations@latest

   //use within angular for supporting some gestures
   npm install --save hammerjs@2.0.8

   npm install --save @angular/flex-layout@latest

```



### angular architecture
- files a combination of html and either typescript or javascript   
- modular
- component-based with templates
- services

> Modular architecture with a root module at the top, which takes the help of other modules organized into modular hierarchy.    
> Root module typically named app.module.

### app.module

```
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule
  ]

  //it's saying that all of these modules need to be imported in order to be used
    with the app.module as part of the hierarchy.
```

```
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ]

  //Declares the view classes that belong to this particular Angular module.
    So these view classes will be in the form of either:
    - components,
    - directives and
    - pipes

```


```
  providers: []

  //All the services that this particular module will make use of

```
