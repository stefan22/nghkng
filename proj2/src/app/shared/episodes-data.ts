    title: "Cartman and Anal Probe",
    description:
      "As Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman wait for the school bus, Kyle's little brother, Ike, tries to follow Kyle to school. Kyle tells Ike he cannot come to school with him. Cartman tells the boys about a dream he had the previous night about being abducted by aliens. The others try to convince him the events did happen and that the aliens are called 'visitors', but Cartman refuses to believe them. Chef pulls up in his car and asks if the boys saw the alien spaceship the previous evening, inadvertently confirming Cartman's 'dream', and relays stories of alien anal probes (which throughout the episode Cartman denies he experienced). After Chef leaves, the school bus picks up the boys, and (looking out the back window) they watch in horror as the visitors abduct Ike. Kyle spends the rest of the episode attempting to rescue him.",

    title: "Starvin Marvin in Space",
    description:
      "This episode begins with an alien landing on Earth to make first contact in the African desert. Not realizing it is facing lions, it is killed and devoured. Its ship is discovered by the people from Starvin' Marvin's village. The village is occupied by Christian missionaries led by Sister Hollis (voiced by Michael Ann Young), who attempt to convert the community by assuring them that their faith in Christianity will get them food, prompting Marvin to board the ship in search of a place free of missionaries to relocate his people. Meanwhile, two agents with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), having found out about this spaceship and wanting it for themselves, track down the boys and torture them by making scraping noises on a balloon until Cartman suddenly cannot take it anymore and tells them where Starvin' Marvin might have taken it. The two government agents then recruit Sally Struthers, whose character is depicted as looking similar to Jabba the Hutt. She is the leader of an Ethiopian food drive that is nothing more than a front for her to get all the food she wants. They offer her Chocolate Yum Yum bars in exchange.",

      "After Mr. Hankey fails to show up on Christmas Day, Kyle leads Stan, Cartman and Kenny into the sewers to investigate. When they find him, Kyle questions him, stating that nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit anymore. Mr. Hankey reveals that he has not surfaced due to issues with his family: his dissatisfied alcoholic wife Autumn, and their children Cornwallis, Amber and Simon. Cornwallis wears glasses, scarf, and hat; Amber wears a hair bow and a dress; and Simon has a peanut sticking out from the top of his head (which renders him as being not too smart). The boys, along with Mr.Hankey's kids, attempt to revive the Christmas spirit by singing carols on the sidewalk, but are totally ignored. While they lament not getting any presents, Cornwallis begins to wonder about his significance in the world as a piece of poo.",

      "Kyle announces that as a birthday treat, his mother Sheila is taking him and three of his friends to Casa Bonita. Cartman's initial joy is crushed when Kyle says he is taking Stan, Kenny, and Butters instead of Cartman, due to him mocking Kyle for being Jewish and calling him names. Cartman decides to prove that he is actually nice, but since kindness is such a foreign concept to him his first attempts are unsuccessful. Eventually he succeeds and Kyle is touched, and tells him that if Butters is for some reason unable to attend, Cartman can. Cartman subsequently tells Butters that a meteor is about to hit Earth and hides him in a bomb shelter, so that he does not appear in time for the trip.Cartman is set to replace Butters when Butters' parents tearfully inform the boys that Butters is missing. Kyle postpones his party until next Saturday. Butters' missing causes a town search party and the police announce they will be checking ducts, wells, and bomb shelters, potentially ruining his evil plan.He then tells Butters that the meteor has hit, civilization has crumbled, and that the world is filled with radioactive cannibals.

    description:
      "The episode begins when a new student enrolls in Ms. Garrison's class. He is named Bahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem, a child of Muslim parents whose mere presence makes Cartman paranoid to the point that he leaves class, asking Ms. Garrison whether Bahir has been searched for bombs. Angered by this, Ms. Garrison tells Cartman to stop being so intolerant, stating that not all Muslims resort to terrorism, but Cartman states that while not all Muslims are terrorists, most of them are. Suspecting that the Muslim kid and his parents are involved in a terrorist attack, Cartman calls Kyle (who is at home in bed, sick), on his cell phone during recess, and Cartman asks him to do a web search for Bahir's background. Cartman also asks Kyle to see if there are important events that day, and figures that Bahir may target Hillary Clinton, who is in town for a political rally. Cartman takes this as a terrorist threat, then proceeds to call the CIA, stubbornly claiming that he will only speak directly to the President.",
