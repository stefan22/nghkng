# reactive forms/ validation support

- use the reactive style of programming for form support
- data flowing btw a non UI data model and a UI form model

- in a reactive approach we create a `tree` of angular `form control` objects

- when building `reactive` forms, we have to `first create` the `form structure` in the
  component and then tie that form structure into `form controls` in `template`.

- so here the component class has immediate access to both the data model as well as the
  form control structure.

- so the data model comming in from the back-end can be mapped in to form control 
  structure which is reflected in to the view through the template

  ### advantages of reactive forms
  - values and validity updates are always synchronous
  - template driven-forms take one cycle
  - easier to unit test

  ### reactive form classes
  - `Reactive Forms` are supported by classes (@angular/forms - library)

    + `FormControl` class.
       powers individual form control, tracks the value and validation status.

    + `FormGroup`  a group of FormControl instances 
       for when you want to organize FormControls together as a group, and track
       the group as a whole.

    + `AbstractControl` class (an abstract based class for FormControl classes)

    + `FormArray` class - enables you to define a numerically indexed array of
       AbstractControl instances 

    +  `FormBuilder` class allows u to create the forms within ur typescript code and
        bind to the template with the template controls
        
        - import FormBuilder from '@angular/forms'
        - then there after you can just construct the form.

        ```
              this.feedbackForm = this.fb.group({
                firstname: '',
                lastname: '',
                mobile: '',
                email: '',
                agree: false,
                message: ''
              });

        ```


### two methods to populate the form model from the data model

- setValue(): this allows you to `assign` every `from control` to a `particular value`
  from `data` model 

- patchValue(): enables you to update `only` some `form controls`.
- the idea -> to create form controls that mirrows the data model as much as possible.

```
    data model  ----> based upon a class ------------> and that closely mirrors the
                                                                form model
```
